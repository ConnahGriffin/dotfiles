## Foreword
 This congfig was from back when I was using Ubuntu 18.04. Some of the files may now be inconsistent with some of the new thing on 20.04.

## My thoughts
- It should be noted that you may have to compile i3-gaps from their github account since there weren't any back when I used Ubuntu
- Some of the shortcuts will need certain packages to run properly but should be easily available in one form or another
