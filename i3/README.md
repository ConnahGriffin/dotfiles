## Foreword 
This config file was/is generated from arch-linux and may or may not function properly on older versions of i3.

## My thoughts
- Editing the i3status is a must unless you use some other type of status bar that is not i3bar.
- Some of the lines may require you to install extra packages like xss-lock
- If your brigness setting doesn't work properly I'd recommend light.
